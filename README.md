# Rumble-interaction-bot

Rumble interaction automation bot

Automation bot that uses Playwright and Asyncio to open undetected browsers.

The bot can like, follow, chat and view

Freqencies can be adjusted in the config file

Residential proxies are needed if you want ads (I suggest Static or Residential proxies fom Webshare.io)

You will need Rumble accounts

You will need a full database of chat messages.  

Once you have all of these things your Rumble channel will get the neccessary interaction required to grow. (use along with a viewbot for live views)
